# bigote
Logic-less templating

Support for compiled mushtache specs that are highly performant. Please check the benchmarks to see for yourself. Still not a usable product.

## Features
Full support for mustache templates. Please refer to examples directory for samples from mustache man pages.

## Performance
Have copied the benchmark code from dust.js and have added bigote for comparison. 

## Notes
  * Inspired by mushtache, dust.js
  * PEG.js - http://pegjs.majda.cz/
